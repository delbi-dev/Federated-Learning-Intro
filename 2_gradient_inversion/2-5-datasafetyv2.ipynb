    "In the previous experiments I (wrongfully) assumed that Federated Learning$^1$ actually respects its privacy guarantees; I mean, we chose Federated Learning because we were in need of a technique that allowed us to train models while keeping our private data safe right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, this is the truth only in an hypotethical fantasy world where everything is sunshine and rainbows (spoiler, it's not).\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember what we said in the first notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Without getting too much into the details, each client has its own local training dataset (images, text...), which is never uploaded to the server; instead, each client computes an update to the current global model mantained by the server, and only this update is communicated (this does mean that some trust of the server coordinating the training is still required, we'll see why in 2.5_DataSafety).\n",
    "\n",
    "> By using this decentralized approach we significantly decrease the risks associated with normal learning methods by limiting the attack surface to only one device (the client side) instead of both the device and the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, Federated Learning obviously was an incredible advancement, such that many researchers tried to test these privacy guarantees; it turns out that there are many, many ways to circumvent the fact that we utilize a decentralized system, most of which are cleverly engineered to work exactly on the final global model's output!\n",
    "\n",
    "The attack methods are almost too many to count, but we can mention a few notable ones:\n",
    "1. Membership Inference Attacks (leaks whether a specific data point or user participated in training)\n",
    "2. Property Inference Attacks (leaks statistical properties of a client’s dataset)\n",
    "3. Model Poisoning (leaks information about other clients’ data, meaning it does require a malicious client)\n",
    "4. Secure Aggregation Bypass (leak individual client updates, even with secure aggregation)\n",
    "\n",
    "While these attacks are all really strong, in this notebook I'm going to focus on an effective but relatively easier to implement method, called **Gradient Inversion (DLG / iDLG)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, one of the biggest misconceptions for novices in ML (which I still include myself into) is thinking that gradients are just \"keys\" used to update our model through optimization. This line of thinking is what actually causes this attack; when we neglect what happens behind the scenes, we often forget that gradients contain more informations then we usually assume (and information that can be privacy regulated at that)."

    "**Gradient inversion** refers to a class of attacks where an adversary tries to recover training *data points* (in our MNIST dataset it obviously represents an image, while in a serious environment it could range from personal photos, to medical records...) from the various *gradients* (aka the local updates produced for each round) shared by a client in a federated learning setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This attack, practically speaking, is tied to the fact that a combination of inputs can generate one and only one gradient as output. Obviously this begs the question, can we do the contrary? can we get the inputs if we have the gradients? The answer, as you'll see shortly, is yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original idea for this type of attack was actually called **Deep Leaking from Gradient (DLG)**$^2$, and we can, on a really high level, imagine the attack with these 4 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first one is **initializing some dummy inputs x' and dummy labels y'**. Why is that? Well, it's because what we are solving is basically a bound optimization problem, in which we start with two random variables in the space and bit by bit try and push them towards the gradient we want to produce, effectively meaning that, when we'll reach the desired gradient, we'll have also undirectly got ourselves the initial inputs we were looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We now need to **compute the dummy gradients**; because we know (as said previously) that the mapping inputs to *gradient is differentiable and deterministic*, we can easily treat this problem as when we normally produce a gradient (aka doing a forward + backward pass):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g(x', y') = \\nabla_{\\theta} \\, L(\\theta; x', y')\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We can now **compare the obtained gradient versus the real gradient** we want to obtain. This is the \"compass\" that we use to update the inputs accordingly\n",
    "4. Finally, we **optimize the dummy data** so that its resulting gradient will match the real gradient; When the optimization converges, x′ and y′ approximate well the original private data\n",
    "\n",
    "What we basically solved with these steps is this problem here:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_{x', y'} \\; \\left\\| \\nabla_{\\theta} L(\\theta; x', y') - \\nabla_{\\theta} L(\\theta; x, y) \\right\\|^2\n",

    "- $ \\min_{x', y'} $ is to represent the fact that, unlike normal optimization problems, we are actually attempting to optimizing data, in this case the two dummy variables\n",
    "- $ \\nabla_{\\theta} L(\\theta; x', y') - \\nabla_{\\theta} L(\\theta; x, y) $ is just the difference between the gradient originated from the dummies and the real one\n",

    "The first gradient inversion attack (at least formally speaking) is widely regarded to be [this one](http://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/hash/60a6c4002cc7b29142def8871531281a-Abstract.html); while this was a seminal result (as it broke the assumption that gradients are \"safe\" to share in distributed and federated settings) soon new improved techniques arised.\n",
    "\n",
    "A latter, more advanced technique, was later called **iDLG (Improved Deep Leaking from Gradients)**$^3$, and utilizes additional insights (e.g., gradient sign behavior under cross-entropy loss) to more reliably recover ground truth labels before reconstructing data (what this means is basically, instead of searching for the right inputs blindly, we search for the label beforehand, making the optimization faster and more reliable).\n",
    "\n",
    "While, as it's probably obvious, iDLG is way more efficient, for this notebook I'll use plain DLG, as the MNIST dataset is simple enough to make iDLG a bit \"overkill\" (and also in the last experiment we used a batch size of 32, meaning that gradients are summed/averaged over 32 samples, effectively breaking the inference assumption in iDLG in which the gradient of the last-layer bias uniquely reveals the label).\n",
    "\n",
    "While we acknowledged how this attack works, there are a few of (real scenario) considerations about the effectiveness of the attack that I'll make before actually providing an example; first of all, the attack works consistently better with *small images, small batches and small architecture* and, while this actually probably helps us in this demo realized on MNIST, it doesn't show its weaknesses against more real life scenarios; secondly, the optimizer is also really important, that's why modern techniques and tools are used, especially Adam and SGD."

    "Wait, the image is completely unrecognizable!\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this is pretty obvious, and it's due to the fact that we used gradient coming out of a federated setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we said before, in distributed settings, the server receives *aggregated gradient updates*, not a single example, but many (in our case the size of the batch is 32); DLG implicitly assumes that the gradients come from one (or at the very most a few) samples, not a full batch; let's repeat the formula we were trying to optimize:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\arg\\min_{x,y} \\left\\| \\nabla_{\\theta} \\,\\ell\\bigl(f_{\\theta}(x), y\\bigr) - g_{\\text{shared}} \\right\\|_2^2\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "In federated/distributed contexts instead the server (and so the attacker who intercepted the aggregated gradient) sees this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "g_{\\mathrm{FL}} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\nabla_{\\theta} \\, \\ell\\bigl(f_{\\theta}(x_i), y_i\\bigr)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where in our case $N = 32$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This generates what can be called a *\"many-to-one collapse\"*, where infinitely many sets $x_i$ produce the same averaged gradient and the pixel-space optimization fails (because it has no preference for which solution may be real).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what causes the corrupt image; DLG asks itself \"what single image could have produced this averaged gradient?\", and the answer if obviously \"no image could have done it\", but still, the optimizer tries finding a pixel-wise barycenter and averaged strokes; the blur we see is not noise, it's just the *true uncertainty of the inverse problem*.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the question switches back to: \"is it really possible to get the input data from those aggregated gradients?\" And the answer is still yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we will use a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**$^5$, which consists of these 3 parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An encoder that maps images\n",
    "* A decoder that maps latent samples\n",
    "* A probabilistic latent space that is smooth and structured\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of optimizing over pixels like in DLG,\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H \\times W},\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "we can optimize over latent variables,\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}, \\qquad x = G(z).\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the optimization objective becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\min_{z} \\;\\left\\|\\nabla_{\\theta} \\, \\ell\\!\\left( f_{\\theta}\\!\\left( G(z) \\right) \\right)-g_{\\mathrm{FL}}\\right\\|_2^2.\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the VAE enforces a **manifold constraint** (only valid digits are allowed), a strong **inductive bias** (meaning that the generator already has a slight understanding of images in the distribution) and **entropy minimization** (among the aggregated gradient, VAE is able to produce the most probable image under the learned data distribution); all of this collapses the solution space to one sharp digit that explains well the aggregated gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we can think of this like training another model on a MNIST like dataset (with digits), and then use for the attack by interpreting the aggregated gradient correctly.\n",
    "\n",

    "The task that we give the encoder is to generate a probability distribution of the latent variable $z$ given the input data (the image) $x$.\n",

    "1. Obviously, the first parameter is the mean $\\mu(x)$, which indicates the center of the distribution (conceptually the encoder predicts where the latent representation should be, this is the “most likely” latent vector); We consider $\\mu(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, meaning that the latent space$^6$ is two-dimensional, effectively bringing us to the conclusion that each image produces two numbers describing the center of its Gaussian in latent space:\n",
    "$\\mu(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mu_1(x) \\\\ \\mu_2(x) \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "2. The second parameter is indeed the variance $\\sigma^2(x)$, which obviously indicates how much the distribution is spread out around the mean; $\\operatorname{diag}(\\sigma^2(x))$ means that each latent dimension has its own variance (this assumption makes the calculations more efficient in general); the covariance matrix then becomes:\n",

    "\\log \\sigma^{2}(x) = \\operatorname{logvar}(x).\n",
    "$\n",
    "This is done because the neural network, if we keep $\\sigma^2(x)$, can in theory output any number, but we know that the variance needs to be always bigger than 0 (or 0 in case of degenerate distributions); also, because variances can be incredibly small, log-space is more stable for optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason that we need the parameters of the distribution is pretty straighforward; basically, without it, we would just produce a single latent vector $z$, which would not give such a smooth and continuos latent space (often with holes and overfitting).\n",

    "Obviously, being this a notebook, it doesn't fully reflect some events that could (and some are even common) in a real system.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DEVICEvsSILO**: The first distinction worthy of raising is the difference between a Cross-device and a Cross-Silo system. While we already explained it in more detail in the NON-IID data notebook, this distinction is especially fundamental, as it completely changes the system perspective altogether. For instance, let's consider two different instances to apply the attack:\n",
    " * In a cross-device context (think for example of Google Keyboard, IoT...) we often have milions of clients, each with only an exponentially small amount of data, with heavily noisy gradients, usually with stronger defences like Secure Aggregation (and often dropouts of all kind). All of this makes gradient inversion attacks much more complicated\n",
    "* In a cross-silo setup (think for example banks or hospitals) instead there are less clients (but more trustworthy), with much more information detained by each one, with more informative gradients, more often than not with even less defences. All of this means that our inversion attack is much more realistic if we take a cross-silo setup as the system at hand.     \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **COMMUNICATION ROUNDS**: Let's remember that Federated Learning (and all other kinds of distributed systems) is not just a single exchange of gradients, but an iteractive process. This means that for each communication round the server sends the model, the clients calculate their gradient, the server aggregates them all and finally it updates the model, ready for another round to happen. Why is this important though? well, because of this fact an attacker usually relies on **cumulative leakage**, which is basically the more technical wording for \"More Rounds = More Information = More Accurate Reconstruction\". This is because the attacker can correlate gradients in the time the updates happen, reconstruct recurrent patterns and even utilize differences between rounds to isolate single contributions in the model (effectively meaning technically obtaining a single example in the aggregation). Basically, in our case, we used a single round, but in reality, if the attacker has access to the aggregated gradients during those rounds, then the attack will likely be even more dangerous.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **CLIENT SAMPLING**: In real distributed systems, not every assigned client will participate in the round (for example due to dropout, more specifically low connection or battery); this introduces systemic vulnerabilities. For instance, if a client X appears only in a few rounds then our server could potentially isolate its contributions, confront rounds with and without that single client, subtract aggragated gradients, and even, in the worst case scenario, obtain an almost single gradient. This means that the potential assurance of the images being aggregated gets completely bypassed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **MODEL ARCHITECTURE & HETEROGENEITY**: In real systems the models are often enormous, clients have different hardware, and gradients are not always equal in structure (some are compressed, some are quantized...). All these factors influence the quality of the leakage, the feasibility of the gradient inversion and the necessity of using VAE or even stronger priors (such as *GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)*$^9$)."

    "One wrong assumption I initially made is thinking that MNIST would actually be the best dataset to test the gradient inversion. I am probably at fault for following the line of thinking \"if it's an easy classifier then it will also be easy for gradient inversion!\", even though it couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, if we value the nature of the problem we come to the conclusion that more privacy-dependent and at first impact more \"difficult\" datasets (for instance, a group of MRI scans) are actually easier to invert and obtain even clearer image, violating privacy guarantees of the system in a more plausible way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is mainly because of **variability**$^{10}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For us humans, classifying the MNIST digits is incredibly easy, but for the computer it is not, and sometimes we don't understand that the number 0 to 9 are incredibly diverse structurally; each class has very different traits, different styles, different inclination, and as we mentioned a batch of 32, which effectively means a mix of completely incompatible forms. This results in the aggregated gradient being a mixture of random signals, DLG fails, and even VAE is only able to produce a plausible digit, but not a really nitid one.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we now consider a batch of MRI scans we notice that they are actually way more structured and with less variability. This is because in the batch the anatomy is the same (everyone has a brain), every image has the same orientation (sagittal axis), same resolution and scale, and even same local variations (e.g. tumors, lesions, oedema...). This in turn means that the aggregated gradient is not just a mixture of incompatible forms, rather a mean of very similar images (we say that the aggregated gradient preserves the anatomical structure).\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this suggests that the prior on MRI is way more powerful than the experiment we tried here. A VAE (or diffusion model) trained on MRI scans knows the brain shape, knows where the ventricules, cortex and medulla are, and knows how tumors, lesion or other anomalies appear. This adds to what we said earlier, even with aggregated gradients, the prior can reconstruct a plausible brain shape, include a mass if the gradient suggests it and also reveal the patological distribution of the entire batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even then, as we mentioned previously, the goal isn't a perfect reconstruction of a single sample, but an informative reconstruction. We don't really care about X's MRI scan, but the reconstruction showing the brain with a lesion in the frontal lobe, a mass consistent with a glioma and a structure that is consistent with the private cohort is already a massive privacy breach that violates:\n",

    "**Latent Space**: The latent space is a compressed, meaningful, smooth representation of data (like images in our case) that a model learns internally. If we want to reconstruct images from gradients they become fundamental; if we optimize pixels directly we get weird blobs, half-digits, noisy artifacts, while if we instead optimize the latent variables then the generator only outputs valid digits, the search space is smaller, the optimization is smoother and as a result the final result is in general sharper and more realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jensen's Inequality**: It's the inequality that explains how nonlinear functions interact with expectations; it's behavior depends on the function:\n",
    "* if the function is concave (think of logx): $\\log \\mathbb{E}[X] \\ge \\mathbb{E}[\\log X]$\n",
    "* if the function is convex (think of $x^2$), the inequality flips: $(\\mathbb{E}[X])^2 \\le \\mathbb{E}[X^2]$\n",

    "In practice it works as a trick; instead of calculating taking the log after integrating, it allows to take the log before integrating, making the integration easier. Basically, it works as the lower bound for the optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ELBO**: Evidence Lower BOund is a safe underestimate of how accurate our produced data is; basically, because as we already said many times we can't really compute the true likelihood, we can use Jensen, which gives us a number to compute our likelihood with, while also telling us that it need to be less than or equal to the true answer (lower bound) and the closer we are the more correct the approximation is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GANs**: Generative Adversarial Network, is a way to teach a computer what real data looks like by making two neural networks compete with each other; one network creates examples and the other network judges them.\n",
    "Through that competition, the creator learns to make data that looks real.\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs can actually be used for gradient inversion purposes, and they are even considered stronger priors than VAEs and other diffusion models; this is for some main differences:\n",
    "1. The first huge difference is *determinism*; GANs are completely deterministic (for same z equals the same x, which means more clean gradient flow), while VAEs, as we saw, involves sampling, inference, noise in reconstruction and gradients estimation.\n",
    "2. In the GAN-based inversion we are optimizing just a small latent vector, while in VAE-based inversion we are often optimizing the variable z, reconstruction noise and even potential encoder mismatch (all of this makes the process of the optimization in general much messier and less efficient).\n",
    "3. GANs models also dominate in other fields, such as output sharpness, latent space geometry and prior strength (in GAN only outputs that look real are allowed, while in VAE anything close to the data distribution is allowed).\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these advantages could give the impressione that GANs are actually better in any scenario, but this is just not true; GAN assumes outputs are sharp, well-aligned on the manifold which, as we saw in the section 4.7. MNIST Digits vs MRI Scans, in our case (MNIST) is just not true, as our manifold is composed of incredibly different digits, meaning the statistically more common manifold is everything but sharp. GANs instead shine for example in MRI Scans, where the data has a strong anatomical structure or regularity, ergo we don’t need the generator to handle huge variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variability**: In this case, variability refers to the differences between each image possible in the batch. As we said previously, digits datasets show a way higher variability than MRI scans, whcih preserve the same anatomical structure for each scan."
