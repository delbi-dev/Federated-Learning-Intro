Hi! I'm a first year BSc in Data Science, and I'm really passionate in whatever includes AI/ML security while keeping a good tradeoff with bot efficency and costs.

Feedback are very welcome! Please keep in mind I have tot take my more advanced classes yet, so don't expect long mathematical demonstrations or pure theorical professor explanations.

**1_intro** contains an intro to FL
**2_GradientInversion** contains my main project on gradient inversion on aggregated clients.
